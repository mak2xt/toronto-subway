# Synopsis

I've been always wondering why Toronto doesn't have good subway map that can help people, especially newcomers, with their routes.
So, I decided to write my own.

# Installation
```
git clone <repository_url>
npm install
```

### Dev Server

``ng serve``

### Build

``ng build --prod``

# ToDo

- [ ] add line 3 to the map
- [ ] use ttc schedule to calculate travel times
- [ ] use ttc subway shapefiles
- [ ] fix overlaying station labels and points
